<section>
<h2 class="text-gray-900 text-3xl font-bold mb-6">About the Global MBA Program</h2>
<div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-xl border border-gray-200 p-8">
<div class="space-y-6 text-gray-600">
<p class="leading-relaxed">In view of the increasingly competitive and closely integrated international business landscape, the demand for international management talent both domestically and abroad has significantly increased. Since its founding, Tunghai University has been committed to creating a quality international learning environment. To meet the growing demand from both Taiwanese and international students for an internationally-oriented, English-taught business administration master's degree, the College of Management at Tunghai University has integrated resources from six departments within the college and the university's international education resources to launch the fully English-taught "Global MBA Program."</p>
<p class="leading-relaxed">The College of Management at Tunghai University emphasizes several key development priorities for the Global MBA: combined classes of local and international students, instruction entirely in English with emphasis on international activities, and diverse learning programs in partnership with sister schools. The program provides multifaceted learning in management theory, cross-cultural literacy, and foreign language communication skills, training students with international business management capabilities, broadening their global perspective, and enhancing their international competitive advantage. Through the integration of solid theoretical foundations with practical workplace applications, we cultivate outstanding international business management and leadership talent.</p>
